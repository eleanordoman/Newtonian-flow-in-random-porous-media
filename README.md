Generates a 2D porous media, constructs network through porous media. The Newtonian resistance for each edge is obtained and then pressure at each vertex and flux along each edge is solved for. Finally pressure and flux are plotted through out domain.

To run, save all files in one folder and run 'master_disordered_doc.mat'. All explaination and code break down is given in 'master_disordered_doc.mat'.
